## Installation
Executables can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/removingnest109/passman/releases) page

If you have Cargo installed, you can also build the program from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/removingnest109/passman.git

cd passman

cargo install
```

If you build the program using "cargo install" on linux, it will place the executable in ~/.cargo/bin/
