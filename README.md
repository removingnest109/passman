## Installation (Windows)
To install passman on windows, just download the passman.exe file from the [Releases](https://github.com/removingnest109/passman/releases) page.

The program is a standalone .exe and can be placed anywhere on the system without issues.

## Installation (Linux)
Executables can be found on the [Releases](https://github.com/removingnest109/passman/releases) page.

To install the executable binary on linux, download and extract the passman-x86_64-linux-bin.tar.gz

This archive contains a binary file that can be placed anywhere in the system, but it is best to place it somewhere that is included in your $PATH

Alternatively, if you have Cargo installed, you can also build passman from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/removingnest109/passman.git

cd passman

cargo install
```

If you build the program using "cargo install" on linux, it will place the executable in ~/.cargo/bin/
